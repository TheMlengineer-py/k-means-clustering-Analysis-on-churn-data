# k-means-clustering-Analysis-on-churn-data
"Can we identify distinct groups of customers based on their product usage and demographic patterns using K-means clustering and tailor our churn reduction and marketing strategies to each group accordingly?"
The goal of performing a k-means clustering analysis on the churn data in relation to customer tenure and geographical coordinates is to identify patterns or segments of customers based on tenure and location, which could aid in developing targeted marketing strategies or retention efforts for each segment. Customers that have been with the firm for a long time yet live in areas with a high churn rate, for example, could be clustered, indicating a need for additional engagement or incentives to stay loyal. Similarly, clusters might be constructed for new customers who live in low-churn areas, highlighting the need for concentrated onboarding efforts to guarantee they become long-term clients
